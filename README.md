# NumericalMethodsDotNet
A .NET library that implements numerical analysis algorithms to solve mathematical problems through approximation techniques. In many cases—such as finding roots of functions, performing integrations, or solving systems of equations—analytical solutions may be difficult or impractical to obtain. Numerical methods offer efficient alternatives for tackling these problems
